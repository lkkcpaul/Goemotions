# Goemotions
Sentiment analysis of Reddit comments

This is my capstone project for UCSD machine learning bootcamp. The data is downloaded from the Kaggle dataset: "Goemotions" 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debarshichanda/goemotions). 
This dataset consists of 58k comments with emotions each labeled by multiple humans. There are 27 (and neutral) emotion labels.
